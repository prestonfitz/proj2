# PDCDonuts - Project 2

To run the project, enter the main folder and run `docker build -t proj2 .` followed by `docker run -dit -p 80:80 proj2`. To run the Terraform code, run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform validate`, and `terraform apply`, then `terraform destroy` to delete your created resources. Automatic deployment can be done by running `./deployinfrastructure.sh` and subsequent destruction of those created resources is done with `./destroyinfrastructure.sh`. Some setup may be needed with installing docker, AWS CLI, terraform, etc, including IAM role creation. You may need to download the latest amazonlinux docker image, which can be done with `docker pull amazonlinux:latest`.
